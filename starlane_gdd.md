# Starlane Runner
When you need something delivered or picked up in dangerous territory, you can't go wrong with a starlane runner.  
Part fighter pilot, part space trucker, these high octane deliverymen can get the job done, for the right price!  

## Gameplay
Vertical shmup with levels generated based on a Slay The Spire style level selection system.  
Player plots a course through the map, then that path is used to generate a shmup level.
